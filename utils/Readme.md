# Install the required software

This test depends on the following software that needs to be installed before any exercises or examples can be run. Please install it on your device before running the examples or exercises.

The `utils` file directory contains the scripts required for installation. In order to facilitate the experiment, binary installation is used. It should be noted that `bmv2` will install an official build version and an unofficial version. The unofficial version will be used in the experiment. It is added New features (single Egress allows multiple queues), and use the built `*.deb` package to install.
